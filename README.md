# Blockchain

This mod allows you to use a litteral blockchain as a weapon in Synchrony.

I don't know yet how it would work, but I guess it would make you move
like with a flail in Cadence of Hyrule (i.e. same range as a whip,
but you move when you don't attack an ennemy directly in front of you).
There would probably be something with gold drop too.
