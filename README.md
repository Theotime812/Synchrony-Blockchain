# Blockchain

This mod allows you to use a litteral blockchain as a weapon in Synchrony.

The blockchain will have the same range as a whip, but attacking an ennemy
that is not directly in front of you will make you move forward (like with
the cat or the flail in Cadence of Hyrule).
Attacking enemies will increase the amount of gold dropped by the next one
if you kill it on the next beat.
If you have more than a certain amount of gold, the weapon damage will be multiplied
by 2. The exact amount changes depending on the depth you're in, and is exponential.
Here are the current values:

| Depth | Gold required |
|-------|---------------|
|     1 |           500 |
|     2 |          1000 |
|     3 |          2000 |
|     4 |          4000 |
|     5 |          8000 |

It should keep on increasing the same way if you use mods which add zones.
